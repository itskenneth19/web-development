This **.css** file includes breakpoints for **Large**, **Medium** and **Small** screens that helps us to make responsive web design faster.

## Codes
**container** - for a single column, it covers the whole size of the row.

    <div class="container">
    // Codes
    </div>

**.col-[num]** - for a specified number of columns, *the total number of columns on a single lines must be twelve (12)

    <div class="row"> // ROW
	    <div class="col-4">
		    // Covered 33.33% of the screen
	    </div>
	    <div class="col-8">
		    // Covered 66.66% of the screen
	    </div>
    </div>
4 + 8 = 12

**Here's the preview of the code.**

As you can see, the both columns automatically set into 100% size of the container in smaller screen.
